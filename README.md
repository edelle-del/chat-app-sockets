# Chat Application Development
Now, another idea on OS will be the Chat Development Application. Now, this can be done with the help
of Computer Networking. A user can load a chat on the internet that is developed with the help of the
Socket Concept.

Development Idea:
1. We have to create the Server-Client Side Architecture using the Socket.
2. Now, using different Network Protocols, we have to transmit the message.
3. You have to develop a server in such a way that it will handle multiple clients at the same time
